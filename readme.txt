Description
===========
Provides cars and road tracks, similar in function to rail carts. This mod
is derived from the boost_cart mod, and relies on it to run.

The road tracks act the same as rail tracks but have a tyre track texture.

The cars work the same as rail carts but also respond to the up/forward (W)
key to start and accelerate.

Controls:
Right click - mount/dismount.
Punch - start/accelerate.
Sneak+Punch - Dig.
Up/forward (W) - start/accelerate.
Down/Back (S) - decelerate/stop.
Left (A) - turn left (if track allows).
Right (D) - turn right (if track allows).

See boost_cart settings for mod settings that effect this mod.
